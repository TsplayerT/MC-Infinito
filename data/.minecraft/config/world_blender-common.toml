	# To blacklist a single feature, enter the mod ID, then :, and then the 
	# feature's name. For example, "minecraft:icebergs" will prevent vanilla's
	# icebergs from being imported but allow other mod's icebergs to be imported.
	# 
	# NOTE: You can blacklist multiple things at a time. Just separate

	# To blacklist a mod's biome, you would enter the resourcelocation

	# then put a : (semicolon), and then the ID of the biome.
	# For example, to blacklist just vanilla's Ice Spike biome, you
	# would put in minecraft:ice_spike and nothing will be imported
	# from that specific biome.
	# 
	# If you want to blacklist an entire mod itself so no importing
